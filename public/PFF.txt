iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF seeks to track the investment
results of the ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred & Hybrid Securities Index, which
measures the performance of a select group of exchange-listed, U.S. dollar-
denominated preferred securities, hybrid securities and convertible preferred
securities listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ. The fund may invest at least 80% of
its assets in the component securities of its underlying index and in
investments that have economic characteristics that are substantially identical
to the component securities of its underlying index.
