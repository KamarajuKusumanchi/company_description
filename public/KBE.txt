SPDR S&P Bank ETF seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and
expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&P Banks
Select Industry Index. The fund generally invests substantially all, but at
least 80%, of its total assets in the securities comprising the index. The
index represents the banks segment of the S&P Total Market Index (S&P TMI). The
S&P TMI is designed to track the broad U.S. equity market. It may invest in
equity securities that are not included in the index, cash and cash equivalents
or money market instruments, such as repurchase agreements and money market
funds.
