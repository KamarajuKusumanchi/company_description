Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF Shares seeks to track the performance
of the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index. This index measures the
performance of a wide spectrum of public, investment-grade, taxable, fixed
income securities in the United States-including government, corporate, and
international dollar-denominated bonds, as well as mortgage-backed and asset-
backed securities-all with maturities of more than 1 year. All of the fund's
investments will be selected through the sampling process, and at least 80% of
its assets will be invested in bonds held in the index.
