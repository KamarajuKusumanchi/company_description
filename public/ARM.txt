Arm is defining the future of computing. We architect, develop, and license
high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient CPU products and related
technology, on which many of the worldas leading semiconductor companies and
OEMs rely to develop their products. Our energy-efficient CPUs have enabled
advanced computing in greater than 99% of the worldas smartphones, for the year
ended December 31, 2022, and more than 250 billion chips, cumulatively,
powering everything from the tiniest of sensors to the most powerful
supercomputers. Today, Arm CPUs run the vast majority of the worldas software,
including the operating systems and applications for smartphones, tablets and
personal computers, data centers and networking equipment, and vehicles, as
well as the embedded operating systems in devices such as smartwatches,
thermostats, drones and industrial robotics. We estimate that approximately 70%
of the worldas population uses Arm-based products, and the scale of Armas reach
continues to expand, with more than 30 billion Arm-based chips reported as
shipped in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 alone, representing an
approximately 70% increase since the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.
