SPAC and New Issue ETF seeks to provide total return. Under normal
circumstances, at least 80% of the fund's net assets (plus borrowings for
investment purposes) will be invested in units and shares of Special Purpose
Acquisitions Companies ("SPACs") that have a minimum capitalization of $100
million and companies that completed an initial public offering ("IPO") within
the last two years. The fund may also invest in depositary receipts for cash
management purposes or due to a lack of suitable investment opportunities, the
fund may hold up to 20% of its net assets in cash or similar short-term, high-
quality debt securities.
