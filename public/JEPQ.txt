JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF seeks current income while
maintaining prospects for capital appreciation. The fund seeks to achieve this
objective by (1) creating an actively managed portfolio of equity securities
comprised significantly of those included in the funds primary benchmark, the
Nasdaq-100 Index (the Benchmark), and (2) through equity-linked notes (ELNs),
selling call options with exposure to the Benchmark. It is non-diversified.
