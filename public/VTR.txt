Ventas, an S&P 500 company, operates at the intersection of two powerful and
dynamic industries  healthcare and real estate. As one of the world's foremost
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT), we use the power of capital to unlock the
value of real estate, partnering with leading care providers, developers,
research and medical institutions, innovators and healthcare organizations
whose success is buoyed by the demographic tailwind of an aging population. For
more than twenty years, Ventas has followed a successful strategy that endures:
combining a high-quality diversified portfolio of properties and capital
sources to manage through cycles, working with industry leading partners, and a
collaborative and experienced team focused on producing consistent growing cash
flows and superior returns on a strong balance sheet, ultimately rewarding
Ventas shareholders. As of September 30, 2020, Ventas owned or managed through
unconsolidated joint ventures approximately 1,200 properties.
