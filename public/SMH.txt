VanEck Semiconductor ETF seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees
and expenses, the price and yield performance of the MVIS US Listed
Semiconductor 25 Index. The fund normally invests at least 80% of its total
assets in securities that comprise the fund's benchmark index. The index
includes common stocks and depositary receipts of U.S. exchange-listed
companies in the semiconductor industry. Such companies may include medium-
capitalization companies and foreign companies that are listed on a U.S.
exchange. The fund is non-diversified.
