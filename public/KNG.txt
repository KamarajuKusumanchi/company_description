FT Cboe Vest S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Target Income ETF seeks investment
results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an equity index

Series. The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in the common stocks
and call options that comprise the index. The index is designed with the
primary goal of generating an annualized level of income from stock dividends
and option premiums that is approximately 3% over the annual dividend yield of
the S&P 500 Index and a secondary goal of generating capital appreciation based
on the price returns of the equity securities contained in the index.
