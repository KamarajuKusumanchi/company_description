WisdomTree Floating Rate Treasury Fund seeks to track the price and yield
performance, before fees and expenses, of the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Floating
Rate Bond Index (the "index"). The fund invests at least 80% of its total
assets (exclusive of collateral held from securities lending) in the component
securities of the index and investments that have economic characteristics that
are substantially identical to the economic characteristics of such component
securities. The index is designed to measure the performance of floating rate
public obligations of the U.S. Treasury. The fund is non-diversified.
