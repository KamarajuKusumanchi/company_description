Snowflake, Inc. provides cloud data warehousing software. This includes the
Data Cloud, an ecosystem where Snowflake customers, partners, data providers,
and data consumers can break down data silos and derive value from rapidly
growing data sets in secure, governed, and compliant ways. Its platform
supports a range of use cases, including data warehousing, data lakes, data
engineering, data science, data application development, and data sharing. The
cloud-native architecture consists of three independently scalable layers
across storage, compute, and cloud services. The storage layer ingests massive
amounts and varieties of structured and semi-structured data to create a
unified data record. The compute layer provides dedicated resources to enable
users to simultaneously access common data sets for many use cases without
latency. The cloud services layer optimizes each use case's performance
requirements with no administration. Snowflake was founded by Marcin Zukowski,
Thierry Cruanes and Benoit Dageville on July 23, 2012 and is headquartered in
Bozeman, MT.
